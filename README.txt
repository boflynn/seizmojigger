This code is being exposed publicly to demonstrate my C# .NET coding ability. There is no distribution license declared as I do not intend to actually distribute this code, nor do I intend for anyone to fork or create derivative works from it, and this use is specifically prohibited.

I am prohibiting this permission because there are many intellectual property questions to be addressed regarding this work.

The base mechanics are recognizably taken from Battleship, the board game originally published by Milton Bradley which was subsequently acquired by Hasbro. I was aware that Yahoo! once published a direct clone of this game to their Yahoo! Games site which was live for over a decade. Their game was 100% accurate to the original game in every mechanic, including 5 ships of the same names and sizes, players taking one shot per turn a piece, the only change I noticed was that it was called "Naval Command" instead. Under the assumption that if a high profile company like Yahoo! could keep such a game live for that long without attracting the attention of Hasbro, then I should not either for similar reasons, something about the patents of their gameplay must allow for such a near clone to exist without conflict. Furthermore, I have added characters and new mechanics that to me make it significantly different from there, so in as much as those features are concerned, I retain copyright.

With regard to the TREMORS series characters, they remain the property of Stampede Productions, though Stampede has informally told me that they are now the intellectual property of Universal Studios. It is not my intention to infringe on this copyright, this game is solely a fan creation created as an homage to the franchise. I can easily and willingly take the game down after a cease and desist order, or re-publish with all character references and details renamed such that the direct references to Tremors are unrecognizable. It should be noted that when some form of this game reaches the production value of something I actually could publish and begin charging money for, I will be seeking to legitimize the references by negotiating some form of license for the characters from Universal.

Thank you,
